lync-logFileParse
=================

Powershell script to automatically parse out the Lync logfiles


To-Do
=================
1.  Convert from Table format to something easier to read
2.  Add main-video1...main-video5, and panoramic-video stats (I'm currently under the assumption that main-video is the current speaker, but I have nothing to back that up with)
